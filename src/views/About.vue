    <h1>Moonbagel Tycoon</h1>
    <p>
      My high school Trigonometry Teacher had difficulty explaining variables to the class. He resorted to drawing Moondoggel Bagel on the blackboard in an attempt to get many people
      in class to not focus on the name of the variable. Theta was the variable of normality inside Sin, Cos and Tan. If the theta wasn't there, many folks would suddenly blank on what to do.

      All parts that appear to be stolen from Orange Tycoon are. The parts that aren't stolen from Orange Tycoon are likely stolen from other places.

      They are inspired by playing Orange Tycoon and saying,
      <ul>
        <li>"Wouldn't it be nice to be able to look at the chart of stock values"</li>
        <li>"Wouldn't it be nice to be able to look at the chart of the progression of machine values"</li>
        <li>"Wouldn't it be nice to be able to look how the values change over time."</li>
        <li>"Wouldn't it be nice to be able to look at the chart of stock values"</li>
      </ul>
